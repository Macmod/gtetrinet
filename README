GTetrinet
---------

GTetrinet is a clone of the popular Tetrinet game for Win95/NT.  It is
designed to be fully compatible with, and to be identical in gameplay to the
original Tetrinet.

For information on how to play the game, see the manpage included with this
package, or refer to the tetrinet.txt file that is included with the original
Tetrinet distribution.  A copy of this file can be found on the GTetrinet
homepage.

If you're looking for a popular public server to play on, take a look at
tetrinet.org.

Tetrinet was originally conceived by St0rmCat.


Requirements
------------

GTetrinet requires GNOME 2.0 or newer.

For sound support, ESD is required.  However, GTetrinet can be compiled
without sound support.

For MIDI music, GTetrinet also requires an external MIDI player, such as
playmidi or TiMidity++.
